          <h1>Communities</h1><hr>
          <p>I would have never found out about all of these glitches if I hadn't found websites
            that explained how they work and why they happen in detail. There are many different
            groups of people who try and find glitches and exploits in games as a hobby, and over time,
            I've become familiar with a few of them. Here are some from the Pokémon community:</p>

          <h2>Glitch City Laboratories</h2>
          <p>Glitch City Laboratories was a forum and wiki that catalogued glitches and other
            oddities people had found in the Pokémon games. They had an extensive number of
            pages on glitch Pokémon in particular. If you were to ever go looking for information
            about Pokémon glitches on a different website, you would find that their source would
            link back here.</p>
          <p>Recently, there was a massive Nintendo leak, and all the source code for the first four
            generations of Pokémon games was made public. The owners of Glitch City Laboratories
            realized that they could no longer prove that new edits didn't come from people who
            were poking around in the source code, so they shut down to avoid being targeted by
            Nintendo's legal team. However, you can still find an archived version of the website.</p>

        <div class="col">
          <h2>Bulbapedia</h2>
          <p>Bulbapedia is a general resource for Pokémon-related information. You can find
            everything there from what a specific Pokémon trading card looks like to what
            happened in an obscure manga. They have a whole section of their website dedicated
            to some of the more common glitches found in the Pokémon games.</p>

          <h2>PRAMA Initiative</h2>
          <p>PRAMA Initiative is a French website similar to Glitch City Laboratories
            that has a catalogue of information about Pokémon glitches. I know a lot less
            about this website because it's not in English, but I did go through a phase
            where I would try to use my basic knowledge of French to try and translate
            everything and understand what they were talking about. Because of this, I do
            know that they have a more in-depth explanation of how some of the bigger
            glitches in the games work than other websites.</p>
